# Wordpress-service

This is a template to create a wordpress and database service. Ready to go.

To use it, create a symlink from your project folder to the `docker-compose.yml` file
in this directory. Then, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the wordpress instance and
`docker-compose down` to stop it.
